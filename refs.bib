abstract = {Based on a recent method of Pople et al for the solution of large systems of linear equations, a procedure is given for accelerating the convergence of slowly converging quasi-Newton- Raphson type algorithms. This procedure is particularly advantageous if the number of parameters is so large that the calculation and storage of the hessian is no longer practical. Application to the SCF problem is treated in detail.},

@article{Coleman1996,
abstract = {We propose a new trust region approach for minimizing a nonlinear function subject to simple bounds. Unlike most existing methods, our proposed method does not require that a quadratic programming subproblem, with inequality constraints, be solved in each iteration. Instead, a solution to a trust region subproblem is defined by minimizing a quadratic function subject only to an ellipsoidal constraint. The iterates generated are strictly feasible. Our proposed method reduces to a standard trust region approach for the unconstrained problem when there are no upper or lower bounds on the variables. Global and local quadratic convergence is established. Preliminary numerical experiments are reported indicating the practical viability of this approach.},

@article{Grozema2002,
abstract = {Recently, it has become possible to measure the mobility of charges along isolated chains of conjugated polymers. The mobility of holes along poly(phenylenevinylene) and polythiophene backbones were reported to be 0.43 and 0.02 cm2 V-1 s-1, respectively. The large difference between the mobility of holes on poly(phenylenevinylene) and polythiophene chains can be attributed to deviations from the coplanar alignment of structural units in the polymer backbone. The effect of such torsional disorder on intramolecular hole transport is studied theoretically in this paper using a model based on the tight-binding approximation. The calculated ratio of hole mobilities along poly(phenylenevinylene) and polythiophene chains was found to be in agreement with experimental findings. For both polymers, estimated mobilities become consistent with the experimental values if polymerization defects and chain end effects are included in the calculations. This suggests that even higher mobilities than those reported here can be realized by improving the effective conjugation along the polymer chain.
